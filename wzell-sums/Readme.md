Subject: VegET model data for MODFLOW 
 
Wes, 
Thank you so much for clarifying earlier in the meeting.
We will provide you with the monthly averages from 2003-2015 in netcdf format for:
•	Precipitation
•	actual ET
•	recharge (deep drainage)
•	surface runoff
for you to test as inputs, etc. in the MODFLOW model.
Again as mentioned, those are data from our first model, please dont share with other teams, yet. 

We will contact you to set up a meeting to explore the option for you to use a Jupyter Notebook to download the data from the cloud directly, if you are interested.
Please let me know what day/times on Thursday/Friday would work best for you? 
Otherwise, we will just put them on our ftp for sharing.

Thank you,
Steffi
